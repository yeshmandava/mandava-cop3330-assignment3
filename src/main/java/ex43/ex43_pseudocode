Info Class -> UserInput(), createWeb()

 - UserInput() method acts as the function that gathers all the information from the user regarding the specifications
   for creating the personal website
   Boolean values will be implemented for the CSS and JS scanners so that it will help with deciding whether or not to
   create those files for the website.

 - createWeb() method creates a new file and then adds that file to the directory using the command .mkdirs
   It then adds an index.html, css, and js file to the website directory based on the specifications collected from
   the UserInput() method
   Boolean values are once again used for all the files to make sure that the files ar actually created in the register.
   If the .createNeFile() command returns false, that means the respective file was not created and the output message
   will not print to console
