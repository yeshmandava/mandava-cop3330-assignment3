FrequencyFinder class ->Main method

 - Main migrates all other classes to the main method
   Then it will use various function from those classes to find the frequency of a certain word, sort it based on the
   number of occurrences and print it all to the console.

Construct class -> Word class, findQuantity(), totalNum(), addWord(), printNum()

 - A class is created which will contain the string word and an int freq. Additionally, a comparator function will be
   used to compare the words from the input file. The .compare command will be used to track frequency.

 - findQuantity() method will first declare an arraylist and then it will initialize and scan in from the input file.
   Within the method we will implement another method called totalNum() that will loop through and track the frequency
   of the words from the in file
   Within the totalNum() method we will use another method called addWord() that will basically add words to the
   arrayList if the word is new from the previously tracked words.

 - printNum() method will act as a formatter for the file and specify the results based on requirements.
   It will return the final histogram to console.
