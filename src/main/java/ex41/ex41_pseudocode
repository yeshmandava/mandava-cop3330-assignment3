NameSorter Class: Main method

 - Contains main and compiles all code from other classes called Sort and Scan. Main will initialize the input and
   output files and pass them on as parametric files to the functions from the other classes.


Scan Class -> ScanPeople(), Comparator Compare_By_Name

 - ScanPeople function Reads in the names from the input file parameter. By mapping the index of the comma in the file,
   It will consider all characters before the  comma as the last name and all char after as first name.

 - 3 functions will be used to separately return the last, first name and return it combined in a readable text

 - Comparator function will be used to compare the names that were scanned in to order them in alphabetic order.

Sort Class -> ScanIn(), Sort(), Output()

 - ScanIn function will implement the ScanPeople function from the previous class to read in the entire file by using
   a while loop until all the names are scanned. It will also create a ArrayList and the names thata er scanned in will
   be added to that list.

 - Sort function will call the comparator function to sort the list that was accumulated above.

 - Output function will print out the sorted list to the output file, as well as the total number of names.
